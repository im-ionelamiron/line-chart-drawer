            Guess the whole proposed trend starting from the last point of the blue line.
            Drag to draw your trend from left to the right, using background color and cursor pointer to find the best path.
            A red background means you are far from the real trend, a green one you are close to it, and
            the arrow pointer suggests you the right direction (up or down) to better follow it.
            At the end you can verify your ability and gain real $$$ from the company you challenged. Bazinga!
